# Spotify 2022 Artist Database
- **Course:** INST 327 - Database Design and Modeling
- **Group Project By:** Aysha Sumaiya, Wince Glory, Anne Bezwada, and Nina Dâ€™Amico

## Introduction
Our idea for the project is to create a music database. This database will provide users with information about their own individual music catalog. This will allow people to have an organized database that keeps track of their music and is organized based on various categories.
The scope of our project is to completely cover every end of a song. For example, the database will cover the basics of a song, such as Song Name, Artist, and Genre. However, our database will also provide information that most people need to learn, such as Producer, Company, or year of release. We chose this topic because, as college students, we spend a lot of time listening to music and having a database where all of our song data is stored could be helpful.

## Target audience:  
Our target audience will mainly be those who listen to music often. Our music database will allow users to organize, manage, and search for music based on their preferences.

## Sample data:  
For sample data, we plan to use the Spotify Web API available to the public. It contains all real data regarding artists, albums, songwriters, producers, etc. We will use some of the data available as the sample and continue using it once we need the real data. The URL is https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/.
